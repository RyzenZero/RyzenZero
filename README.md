- Hello, my full name is Jorge Nicolas Ort√©z Vazquez.
- Study Bachelor of Computer Engineering.
- Because I like programming? it was more than anything to know and learn what the development of video games is like.
- I continue to learn on my own, as the development of desktop applications, APIS and mobile development calls my attention at the moment no.
- My skills are basic (Java, and .Net C Sharp) Visual Studio and NetBeans.
- I still do not have a portfolio of work, but as soon as I have several of my projects or practices I will share them with the community.
- My favorite hobbies are videogames, music and playing guitar.
- GamerTag #RyzenZero.
